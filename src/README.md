# src folder

This folder contains the React application source. The layout is organized into the following folders:

- `components/` - Reusable UI components and layout bits.
- `components/ui` - Small UI primitives, e.g. `Button`.
- `components/layout` - Header/Footer and other layout components.
- `pages/` - Route-level pages; `Landing` is the main entry.
- `layouts/` - App layouts; `MainLayout` wraps page content.
- `assets/` - Images, icons, and static assets.
- `styles/` - Global and page-specific styles.
- `services/` - API wrappers and external services.
- `store/` - State management (Redux/Context).
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks.

Routing
-------
This app uses React Router for page navigation — run `npm install react-router-dom` and resume with `npm start`.

This README intentionally kept small; expand as the app grows.
